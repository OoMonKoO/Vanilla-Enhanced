Vanilla-Enhanced
================



Vanilla Enhanced is an Mod for the Indie Game Minecraft.

VE enhanced the Production Chains to make it more difficult and in some Points more realistic to produce. 

But most of the End Products are better then the Vanilla ones. 

I try to keep it as Vanilla as possible but make it a little bit harder and i hope more interesting to play

Vanilla Minecraft.


FEATUERS: ( This list will be longer over the dev time )

+ Complete new production chains for most of the vanilla Items and Blocks
+ Better End Results for some of the Items because of the enhanced Production Chains!


PLANNED FEATURES: (coming soon)

+ An faster Vanilla Furnace
+ Vanilla OreÂ´s are not dropping the whole Block anymore. They drop an Raw Ore instead.
+ Enhanced Trades for the Villagers
+ Some colored Glass, GlassPanes, BrickBlocks for more variations in Buildings. But no Fanzy Colors like red,blue ect.
+ In later Stages i will add Blocks in Medival Style like Blocks with woodenFrames on it.

More to come in later Statges or on Suggestions.




Any Suggestions are welcome!


Looking for someone who can make Textures for the Mod, because im a noob in this :)
